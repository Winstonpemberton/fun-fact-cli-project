1. choose what you want to make your cli about
I think it'll be interesting to have a cli that tell you fun facts.

2. choose a website to scrape
WTF fun facts is a perfect place to find fun facts, I've been using it for years and it holds all the information
I'm going to need.

3. Decide to go from the outside in or the opposite
After watching all the walkthrough videos with Avi, I think inside out would be the best way to go about this.
it just seems like I'll catch things that or think about things better starting from the smallest and going bigger

4. How many classes
Five class to start with. Facts, Categories, Scraper, Menu, CLI console
Facts have names, dates, descriptions, sources
Categories have names, facts
Scraper scrapes information about categories and facts
Menu is going to have a call method to actually run the program, greets the user, gives them the option
to choose a category or get a random fact
CLI console will have one line and that's just calling the call method in the menu class
