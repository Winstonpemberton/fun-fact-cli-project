# CliProject

Welcome to my Fun Fact Generator gem, this gem gives you eight facts about 14 different categories, which is a total of 112 facts. The main menu will ask if you want to see a list of categories or just get a random fact. When you select a category each fact will be displayed to you one by one and you'll be asked whether to get the next fact, go back to the list of categories or to go back to the main menu. The program can be terminated in the main menu by pressing three.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'fun-fact-cli-project'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install fun-fact-cli-project

## Usage

Once the gem is installed type ./bin/console

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.
